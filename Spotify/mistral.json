        "Question": "Does the policy clearly outline data collection practices?",
        "Answer": " Yes, the policy does clearly outline data collection practices. It specifies the types of personal data collected, the purposes for which it is collected, and the legal mechanisms used to transfer data internationally in compliance with EU legislation. The policy also outlines measures taken to protect the security of personal data and provides information on how users can contact the company regarding any questions or concerns about their data privacy. However, it's important to note that this summary is based on the provided text and assumes it accurately represents the entirety of the policy. I would recommend carefully reviewing the full policy for a complete understanding of the data collection practices."
