        "Answer": "Yes, the policy clearly outlines data collection practices, including:\n\n1. What type of data is collected (e.g. personal data, usage data)\n2. How that data is used (e.g. for providing services, improving experiences)\n3. With whom that data is shared (e.g. Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners)\n4. Under what conditions data may be disclosed to third parties (e.g. law enforcement, government agencies)\n\nThe policy also explains the legal mechanisms used for international data transfers (SCCs, adequacy decisions) and provides information on how users can exercise their rights under those mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the policy provides a clear and detailed explanation of Spotify's data collection practices, which is essential for transparency and user understanding."
