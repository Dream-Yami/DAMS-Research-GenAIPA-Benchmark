        "Question": "Does the policy clearly outline data collection practices?",
        "Answer": " Yes, the Privacy Policy Document outlines that Spotify does collect personal data from its users (Part 1). However, it doesn't specify the exact types of personal data collected. It does clarify that they do not collect or use personal data from children under the applicable age limit in each country or region where the service is offered (Part 5). For detailed information on specific data collection practices, I recommend referring to the updated version of the policy available on the Spotify website."
