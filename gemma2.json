        "Question": "Does the company minimize data retention periods?",
        "Answer": "While the document doesn't explicitly state that Spotify minimizes data retention periods, it does mention they have \"access and retention policies\" in place to protect user data and prevent unnecessary storage. \n\n\nIt also highlights that they are committed to protecting user data and use various safeguards to secure it.  \n\nTherefore, while not directly stated, these measures suggest a commitment to responsible data handling practices, which likely include minimizing data retention periods where possible. \n"
