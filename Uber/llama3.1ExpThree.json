Hence, a score of +0.5 is appropriate.\n* Clarity: The LLM answer does not provide clear and easy-to-understand information regarding the types of data collected by Uber, which is partially relevant to the annotated answer. A score of +0.5 is appropriate.\n* Reference: The LLM answer does not mention any specific policy section or provide a reference for its claims. Hence, a score of -1 is appropriate.\n* Relevance: The LLM answer does not mention contact information, user content, and data collected from individuals who start but do not complete their applications to be drivers or delivery persons as specified in the annotated answer. Hence, a score of -1 is appropriate.\n* Accuracy: The LLM answer incorrectly states that Uber shares user data with restaurants and merchants for communications, whereas the annotated answer specifies that the policy explains how Uber shares user data with these entities. Hence, a score of -1 is appropriate. "
