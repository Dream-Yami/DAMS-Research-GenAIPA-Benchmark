        "Question": "Does the policy clearly outline data collection practices?",
        "Answer": "Yes, the policy clearly outlines data collection practices. Specifically, the **Data Sharing** section mentions that users can opt-in to share contact details with restaurants or merchants, which implies that Uber collects this information when users choose to do so (Referenced from \"Data Sharing\" section). However, it's worth noting that the document doesn't explicitly state what types of data are collected beyond what is shared."

    {
        "Question": "How does the privacy policy address potential conflicts of interest in data usage or sharing?",
        "Answer": "Based on the summary provided, it appears that the Privacy Policy Document does not explicitly mention addressing potential conflicts of interest in data usage or sharing.\n\nHowever, I can note that users have control over their data through various options such as opting-in/out to share contact details with merchants, controlling device permissions, and making marketing choices (Section marked \"* **Data sharing**\" and \"* **Marketing and advertising choices**\"). This suggests that Uber prioritizes user consent in handling their data.\n\nIf I had to make an educated guess, I'd say that the lack of mention on conflicts of interest is because Uber's approach focuses more on giving users control over their own data rather than explicitly addressing potential conflicts. Nonetheless, if a specific question was raised about conflicts of interest, users can still exercise their rights through channels like user data requests (Section marked \"* **User data requests**\")."

        "Question": "Can i opt out of letting them collect data and still use the app?",
        "Answer": "According to **Opt-in Sharing** part of the summary, you can choose to share your contact details with certain restaurants or merchants to receive communications from them, and also opt-out through the app settings. This implies that you can still use the app without sharing your contact details, but this specific mention is focused on sharing contact details for marketing purposes, not data collection in general.\n\nHowever, based on **User Data Requests** part of the summary, it's mentioned that \"users have control over how their data is used\" and they can make various requests regarding their data, such as updating or correcting data, deleting account data, objecting to data use, etc. This implies that users do have some level of control over their data collection.\n\nBut more explicitly, there isn't a direct statement saying \"you can opt-out of data collection and still use the app\". However, it's implied through the various options for controlling data provided under **User Data Requests**.\n\nIn practice, to confirm whether you can opt out of data collection and still use the app, I would suggest checking the actual policy or contacting Uber support directly."
