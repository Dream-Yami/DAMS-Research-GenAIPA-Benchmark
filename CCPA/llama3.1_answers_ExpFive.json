Specifically:\n\n*   For-profit entities\n*   Have annual gross revenues exceeding $25 million\n*   Derive 50% or more of their annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information\n*   Employ at least 5 full-time employees to collect, sell, or process consumer data\n\nAdditionally, certain types of businesses, such as financial institutions and healthcare providers, may be subject to different regulations under California law.\n\nIf a business meets these criteria, it must comply with the CCPA's requirements regarding consumer data collection, processing, and disclosure, including providing consumers with notice and opt-out rights."
