These settings might influence how apps and websites collect and use data, but they don't necessarily control everything across all platforms.\n* **Third-Party Apps:**  Apps themselves may have their own privacy settings that override broader platform settings. Users should review the privacy policies of each app they use to understand how their data is handled.\n\n\n**In short, there's no easy answer.** Users need to be proactive and review the privacy settings of both companies and individual apps they use across all their devices and platforms. \n"
