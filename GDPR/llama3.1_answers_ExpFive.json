        "Question": "Does the GDPR require encryption?",
        "Answer": "Based on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), I would say that while encryption is not explicitly mentioned as a requirement, it is implied as a best practice for ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of personal data.\n\nThe GDPR requires organizations to implement \"appropriate technical and organizational measures\" to ensure the security of personal data (Article 32). Encryption is widely considered an essential measure to protect personal data from unauthorized access or breaches. However, the GDPR does not provide specific guidance on encryption requirements, leaving it up to each organization to determine what measures are appropriate for their specific context.\n\nIn practice, many organizations subject to the GDPR do implement encryption as part of their overall security and compliance strategy, particularly when processing sensitive data such as personal identifiable information (PII) or special categories of data like health records."
