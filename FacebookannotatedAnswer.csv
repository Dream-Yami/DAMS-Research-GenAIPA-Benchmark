"Yes, Facebook did provide users with controls over their privacy settings. Ref. (Part 3)"
"Yes, clear mechanisms exist for users to request data deletion or access. Users can access, rectify, port, and erase their data through their Facebook and Instagram settings. Data is stored until it's no longer necessary for providing services, or until the user's account is deleted. Specific examples given include being able to access and delete search queries, with logs of searches being deleted after 6 months, and copies of government-issued IDs submitted for verification being deleted after 30 days. When a user deletes their account, their posted content, like photos and status updates, are deleted and cannot be recovered, but information others have shared about the user isn't part of the user's account and won't be deleted. If a user doesn't want to delete their account permanently, they can choose to deactivate it temporarily. Ref. (Part 3)"
"Facebook manages user consent and withdrawal of consent as follows: Data Management Tools: Users are provided with tools to access, rectify, port, and erase their data, as found in the Facebook and Instagram Settings. This allows users to have control over their data and manage it directly through their account settings. Data Retention Policy: Data is stored only until it is necessary to provide services and Meta Products, or until the user's account is deleted, whichever occurs first. This approach suggests that data retention is limited to what is necessary for service provision. Case-by-Case Data Retention: The retention period for data is determined based on factors such as the nature of the data, its collection and processing purposes, and legal or operational retention needs. Account Deletion: Deleting an account leads to the removal of user-generated content like photos and status updates, which cannot be recovered later. However, information shared about the user by others is not deleted with the userâ€™s account. Account Deactivation Option: Users not wishing to permanently delete their account can choose to deactivate it temporarily. This allows users to suspend their use of the Products without complete data erasure. Account Deletion Process: Users can delete their accounts at any time by visiting the Facebook and Instagram Settings. (Part 3)"
